\subsection{Alternative democracy indices}

\textcolor{red}{Note: Mostly copy and pasted from Acemoglu et al.'s robustness section.}


To examine the robustness of our specification, we select a set of alternative democracy indices: the representative government index issued by International IDEA, and the polity index issued by the Center for Systemic Peace. 

Figure \ref{fig:first-stage-indices} shows the first-stage relationship between the alternative democracy indices and European settler mortality. Similarly to Figure \ref{fig:first-stage}, higher European settler mortality is associated with lower democracy scores. 
    
Table \ref{tab:2sls-indices} presents the results of the 2SLS regression using the three indices. In Panel A column (3), the estimates using the representative government index is statistically significant and point to a positive and large effect of democracy, 419.7 (s.e. 226.7) on Covid-19 mortality. Although the results in (4), (5) and (6) in Panel A are not statistically significant at the 10\% level, we continue to find positive coefficients. In Panel B, where the dependent variable is the change in GDP between 2019 and 2020, we find statistically significant coefficients for both the representative government index and the polity index. Overall, the use of other indices for democracy supports the conclusion that democracy has caused more Covid-19-related deaths and greater economic loss.
