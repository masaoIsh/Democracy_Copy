In conclusion, our empirical analysis suggests that democracy is not only associated with but has caused more deaths attributed to Covid-19 and greater GDP loss between 2019 and 2020. These results are significant and robust to 2SLS standard errors. Moreover, this causal effect of is a global phenomenon and not driven by the US and China alone. 

What are the implications of these results? We acknowledge the focus of this paper is specific to the Covid-19 pandemic and thus the interpretability of these results on the general effects of democracy, both in time span and situation, may be limited. Nonetheless, we believe that, in a world where democracy is widely considered as a universal good, providing a case where democracy seems to have a significant negative causal relationship on civilian life, is a somber yet truthful step towards considering how political systems can be improved or changed.
