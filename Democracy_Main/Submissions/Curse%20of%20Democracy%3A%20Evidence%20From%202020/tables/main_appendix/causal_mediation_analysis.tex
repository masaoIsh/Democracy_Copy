\item {\footnotesize {\textit{Notes:} This table reports the results of causal mediation analyses of democracy's effect on Covid-19 outcomes with three potential mediators: severity, coverage, and speed of policy responses. All regressions use log European settler mortality as an IV. The Democracy Index (Freedom House) is the sum of the political rights and civil liberties scales from \emph{Freedom in the World 2020} by Freedom House. It is normalized to have standard deviation one. We proxy for severity by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker's Containment Health Index at the 10th confirmed Covid-19 case, for coverage by the number of domains the policy covers at the 10th confirmed Covid-19 case, and for speed by the number of days between the 10th case of Covid-19 and the date when the government introduces any containment measure.  Panel A reports the breakdown of democracy's effect on GDP growth rates in 2020 into its direct effect and its indirect effect through the mediator. Panel B reports the same breakdown for democracy's effect on Covid-19-related deaths per million. All regressions are unweighted. The estimates in this table are slightly different from those in Table \ref{tab:2sls-compare-weighting} because the sample definitions are different (In Table \ref{tab:2sls-compare-weighting}, we exclude Venezuela because we do not have its GDP data. In Table \ref{tab:causal-mediation}, we exclude Guinea-Bissau because we do not have data for its containment health index.) Robust standard errors are in parentheses.}}
