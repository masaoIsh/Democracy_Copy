    Containment Health Index at 10th Covid-19 Case & \citet{OxCGRT} & The containment health index measures the strictness of government responses by taking the average of 13 sub-scores that considers the severity and geographic scope of measures in its domain. The sub-scores first records severity on an ordinal scale (for example, the school sub-index is on a 0 (no measure) to 4 (require closing) scale) and subtracts 0.5 if it is targeted. Then, the scale is normalized. The domains are schools, workplaces, public events, gatherings, public transport, stay-at-home requirements, domestic travel, international travel, public information campaigns, testing, contact tracing, facial coverings, and vaccinations.
